# Relapse Velocity Monitor (RVM)

## Predictive Mood & Cycle Insights: Transforming Self-Awareness into Prevention

### The Mission

Current mood trackers are **reactive** they show you what *already* happened. The **Relapse Velocity Monitor (RVM)** is built to be **proactive**. Our mission is to provide users with gentle, predictive insights that help them navigate emotional risk zones *before* a small dip becomes a major struggle. We turn introspection into compassionate prevention.

### The Problem with Existing Trackers

Most mood tracking tools miss the big picture:

* **They are rear-view mirrors:** They record your feelings but offer no foresight to help prevent a difficult day.
* **They overlook key anchors:** They fail to integrate powerful **physiological patterns**, such as the **menstrual cycle**, which significantly influences mood, energy, and sensitivity.
* **They lack context:** They don't connect minor behavioral changes (like reduced sleep or overspending) to a larger emotional trend.

### ✨ Our Solution: The Relapse Velocity Score

The RVM addresses this gap by monitoring the **speed and intensity** with which an individual's emotional state is shifting their **Relapse Velocity**.

#### How It Works (The Core Concept)

The system is powered by combining two essential types of personal data:

1.  **Physiological Anchors:** Key biological rhythms that affect mood (primarily the menstrual cycle).
2.  **Behavioral Micro-Relapses:** Subtle deviations from your normal habits (e.g., increased screen time, neglecting exercise, irregular eating).

The system continuously calculates a **Relapse Velocity Score** based on these patterns. A rising score suggests the user is approaching a sensitive phase or an emotional risk zone, allowing for timely intervention.

### The Output: The Proactive Nudge

RVM doesn't issue warnings; it offers support. When the **Relapse Velocity Score** hits a personalized risk threshold, the system sends a **Proactive Nudge**.

These nudges are context-aware and empathetic reminders, designed to encourage immediate self-care:

> **Example Nudge:** *"It’s okay to feel low or exhausted right now. You are entering a sensitive phase, so try taking a break from your screen or engaging in a soothing activity. This stage will pass; you’re doing great."*

The output is designed to **soothe, not correct**, fostering a compassionate and humane approach to emotional regulation.
